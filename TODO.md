The gist of it:

- Enable via deliberate user action
- Spawn relevant kernel (determined from syntax)
    - "Run" block/line/selection upon user action
    - Provide autocompletions upon user action (hook into builtins in ST & Jupyter?)
    - Display relevant documentation on user action/cursor placement/autocompletion selection
